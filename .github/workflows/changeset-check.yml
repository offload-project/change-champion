            This PR does not include a changeset. If this change should be included in the changelog and trigger a release, please add one:

            \`\`\`bash
            cc add
            \`\`\`

            If this change doesn't need a release (e.g., docs, tests, CI), you can ignore this message.

            <summary>What is a changeset?</summary>

            A changeset is a markdown file in the \`.changes/\` directory that describes what changed and how it affects the version number (major, minor, or patch).
